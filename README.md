## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

- Build out the landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Materials:

Design files are inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format, for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin` were guessed in a best effort to approximate the given design. 

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets were already optimized. (this is how awesome [FrontEndMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) are.)

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
